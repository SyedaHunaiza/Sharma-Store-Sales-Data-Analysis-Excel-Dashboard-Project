# Sharma-Store-Sales-Data-Analysis-Excel-Dashboard-Project     
This project presents a comprehensive sales analysis for Sharma's Store using Microsoft Excel. The dataset includes over 28,000 customer orders, capturing detailed information such as order ID, customer demographics (age, gender), order date, purchase amount, channel, product details, shipping location, and status. The data has been processed and visualized through a structured approach using Pivot Tables, Slicers, and Excel formulas to extract actionable business insights.

The main dataset (Sharma Store) was cleaned and structured, and categorized into age groups (Teenager, Adult, Senior) and monthly trends. Multiple sheets have been used to create focused Pivot Table analyses:

"Sales vs Order" compares total revenue (Sum of Amount) and order volume (Count of Order ID) across months.

"Sales Men vs Women" breaks down sales by gender, highlighting that women contribute significantly more to overall revenue.

"Order Status" tracks the volume of delivered, cancelled, and refunded orders, with the majority marked as delivered.

"Top 5 States" identifies Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh as the highest revenue-generating regions.

"Age vs Gender" visualizes demographic engagement using percentage breakdowns across age and gender.

"Channel" analyzes order distribution across platforms, revealing Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra as the leading sales channels.

To enhance interactivity, Slicers were used for filtering based on Month, Gender, Channel, and Age Group across multiple Pivot Tables, offering a dynamic user experience. The dashboard also includes dedicated sheets for Key Insights and a Final Strategic Conclusion, which recommend steps such as: targeting female customers with personalized campaigns, focusing on the 30â€“49 age group, investing in key geographic states, and optimizing presence on high-performing e-commerce channels.

Overall, this Excel-based data analysis project demonstrates effective use of Pivot Tables, slicers, sorting, helper columns (for custom sorting like months), and data visualization to support data-driven business decisions.
